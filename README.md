# AndroidFTP
## Android FTP Client

This is a project I've created, trying to learn Android.
AndroidFTP is an FTP client for android, allowing you to manage connections to FTP servers. It allows the user to download/upload files to the FTP server, delete and rename/move files.
This application is essentially an Android interface for Appache's [FTPClient](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/apidocs/org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClient.html) which is used as a black box.  
Apart from learning to create user interfaces in android, I've also learned how to perform async actions in Android, as well as writing storage and network related code.

While being fully functional, I've abandoned the project, and therefore it lacks of finishing touches, such as some minor bug fixing, design, and has some missing features.
